# Walmart Sales Analysis & Forecasting

## Overview
This project focuses on **analyzing Walmart sales data** to identify
**sales trends, seasonality patterns, and demand behavior** over time.
The analysis helps understand historical performance and, where applicable,
applies **forecasting techniques** to predict future sales.

Such analysis is widely used in **retail analytics, supply chain planning,
inventory management, and business decision-making**.

## Problem Statement
Retail organizations like Walmart generate massive volumes of sales data.
Without proper analysis, it becomes difficult to:
- Identify sales trends
- Detect seasonal patterns
- Anticipate future demand

This project aims to transform raw sales data into **actionable insights**
using data analysis and time-series techniques.
