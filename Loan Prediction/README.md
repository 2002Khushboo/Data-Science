# Loan Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting loan approval status based on applicant
and loan-related attributes using machine learning techniques.
The objective is to build a reliable classification model that assists
financial institutions in making data-driven loan approval decisions.

---

## Problem Statement
Manual loan approval processes can be time-consuming and prone to bias.
Using historical loan data, this project aims to predict whether a loan
application should be approved or rejected based on key applicant features.

---

## Dataset
The dataset consists of historical loan application data and is divided into
training and testing sets.

### Key Features
- Applicant income
- Co-applicant income
- Loan amount
- Loan term
- Credit history
- Property area
- Applicant demographics

The target variable indicates whether the loan was approved or not.

## Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling where required

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understanding feature distributions
   - Analyzing relationships between features and loan approval status

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Selection of relevant features
   - Transformation of input variables to improve model performance

4. **Model Building**
   - Trained machine learning classification models
   - Compared multiple algorithms to evaluate performance

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion matrix
   - Other relevant classification metrics
